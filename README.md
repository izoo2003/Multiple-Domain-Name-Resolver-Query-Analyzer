# Domain Name Resolver & Query Analyzer

A Python-based networking tool designed to resolve domain names into IP addresses and analyze network performance metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of network paths. It resolves multiple domain names to their respective IP addresses and calculates critical performance data, including the number of network hops and hops-per-second.

## 📊 Key Features
* **Multi-Domain Resolution:** Batch resolve domain names to IPs.
* **Network Analysis:** Tracks hop counts and calculates execution speed (hops/sec).
* **Performance Comparisons:** Compares latency and route efficiency across different hosts.
* **Graphical Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib to generate data-driven charts for easy metric analysis.

## 📂 File Structure
* `CN_Project_Code (2).ipynb`: The core Jupyter Notebook containing the resolution logic and analysis.
* `CN Project Proposal.docx`: Initial project documentation and objectives.
* `DNS_Resolver_Final_Report (1).docx`: Comprehensive final report of findings and performance data.
* `anas pt 2.mkv` & `izaan pt 1.mkv`: Video demonstrations showing the code in action.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**: Core logic and networking libraries.
* **Matplotlib**: Graphical data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.
2. Open `CN_Project_Code (2).ipynb`.
3. Run the cells to begin the domain resolution and view the generated performance graphs.
